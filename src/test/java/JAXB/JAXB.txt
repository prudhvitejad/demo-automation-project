The Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) provides an API and tools that automate the mapping between XML documents and Java objects (POJOS).
The JAXB framework enables developers to perform the following operations:

Unmarshal XML content into a Java representation
Access and update the Java representation
Marshal the Java representation of the XML content into XML content

- in JDK9 and JDK10 JAXB became deprecated. 
- Since JDK 11 it was removed.
- In order to use JAXB in the later version of JDK, we need to include the dependencies and use it
